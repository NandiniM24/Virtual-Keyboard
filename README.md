# Virtual-Keyboard
I am presenting here a next generation technology in this area, which is the Virtual Keyboard. As the name suggests the virtual keyboard has no physical appearance. In the current scenario we use keyboards which have specific size and specific imprints on the keys. The interactivity and usability of keyboards would surely increase if it could display a symbol for the current function associated with the key or if the language of the keyboard could be changed.


Python libraries required:

OpenCV    : pip install opencv-python
Pickle    : pip install pickle-mixin
Numpy     : pip install numpy
PyAutoGUI : pip install pyautogui
Parser    : pip install argparse
